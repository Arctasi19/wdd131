      <h3>Portfolio</h3>
      <p>
        This page will will include a gallery of my projects, both school projects and personal projects. 
        The primary focus will be to showcase my talents and skills, showing my ability to create and develop projects that are both functional and visually appealing.
        Each project will include a brief description including the projects, purpose, methods used, and any challenges faced during the development provess.
        I will include links or download options for each project, allowing visitors to view or download the projects individually.

        Example projects may include:
        Number game for Harvard CS50 course.
        A simple game constructed in python using VS Code. 
        The game will prompt the user for a difficulty level, then provide a series of randomly generated math problems for the user to solve.
        After the user completes the questions, the game will provide the user's score.

        Card Game 21 - Personal Project
        A card game created in python using VS Code, played in the terminal window.
        The game will randomly provide the user with a hand of cards. The user will then have to decide whether to hit (take another card) or stand (keep their current hand). The goal is to get as close to 21 as possible without going over.
        The computer will also have a hand of cards which the user must beat to win. 
        
        Prep-Sheet calculator - Personal Project for my employer.
        A simple calculator created in python using VS Code, designed to help my team calculate specific quantities of ingredients needed for a target amount of food.
        The calculator will prompt the user for the target amount of food, then provide the user with a list of ingredients and their quantities needed to achieve that target.
        Within the calculator is a list of menu items and the ingredients needed to create them.
